# Game description

## Even or odd
In this game, you will be presented with a random number, you need to determine if this number is even or not.
## Calculator
In this game, you will be given random mathematical operations, you need to give the result of the calculations.
## GCD
In this game you will be given two random numbers, you need to find the greatest common divisor for them.
## Progression
In this game you will be given a series of numbers in a mathematical progression of random length with one missing number, you will be required to enter the missing number
## Prime number
In this game you will be given a random number, you will have to guess if the number is prime
